# Handbook: Project Structure and Methods (Kriterienkatalog Ãœbertragbarkeit)

The Handbook serves as the basis for the development and documentation of all methods and tools.
It aims to ensure good transferability to other case studies at a later date. 

## Project structure

### GitHub repos

* **organisation**: contains project overview, data workflows and best practices
* **sl-app**: development of "Scenario-Explorer" front-end
* **oemof-B3-robust**: development of SLE energy model
* **oemof-solph**: oemof-solph implementation with robustness features

## Modularity 

## Documentation 

**Code**: GitHub

**Manuals**: 
* Final report
* Best-practice guide
  * Elaborates methods and reasoning of data processing
  * Helps new sl-app users to understand how to apply sl-app to their region



## Interfaces 

**datamodel**: #TODO: explain data pipeline from start to end and datamodels used once final

**Scenario-Explorer**: interface to explore regional renewable energy investment scenarios 

## Open Licences for Code and Data



## Metadata standards

The [OEMetadata](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata) are used for data documentation. Open Energy Metadata (OEMetadata) is an energy metadata standard including a template, examples and a metadata schema. It is an extensive set of metadata based on the tabular data package specifications and the FAIR principles. The metadata contains multiple fields (keys) in a nested JSON structure.
